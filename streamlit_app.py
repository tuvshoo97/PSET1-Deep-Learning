Get ready to impress your Mongolian friends with your knowledge of traditional holiday foods! With this app, you can upload an image of Tsuivan, Khuushuur, Buuz, or Niislel salad and find out which delicious dish it is. Who needs a taste tester when you've got this app? 

This app was created as a fun demo for the Deep Learning course at LETU Mongolia American University, but we won't judge if you use it to win food trivia night. üç¥""")
